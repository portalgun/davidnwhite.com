    Perception is a process of filtration and reconstruction.
	The brain takes in a visual scene, seperates features of the scene by filters, then creates many new unique representations of that scene, characterized by those individual features.
	Those features can be anything you might assign "quality" to, such as color, speed, texture, etc..
	Such is the case of 3D perception: each eye samples a 2D representation from the environment, then the brain filters those images focusing with the differences between the two channels (depth disparity).
	From this the brain creates a new representation where objects in the scene can be percieved as further or closer away from others.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
	I am interested in discovering what constitutes those filters, also known as recepetive fields.
	More precicely I focus on how they deviate from what could be considered ideal.
	Using high resolution 3D images from the natural environment along with range data and an evolutionary paradigm, we can determine the set of receptive fields that would ideally encode a given task.
	This process of determining an ideal model uses a process called Accuracy Maximization Analysis (AMA), which is  a hybrid between component analysis, a bayesian optimal observer, and a learning algorithm.
	In the process of returning receptive field model, AMA also returns the performance on the psychophysical task it used to generate those receptive fields.
	We then compare the performance of the machine model to those from human psychophysical experiments.
