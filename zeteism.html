      <p>
      Zeteism (zeet-ism), or Zetesciism (zeet-shism),
      is a post-religious philosophy of existence (phrenon). 
It is apotheistic, and ground-upwards driven.
Based upon the Jungian archetypes, Zetesciism focuses heavily on shadow/unconsious aspects, which is where it derives its name:
      A Zetesciist or Zeteist is someone who is mindfully and continuously exploring the shadow/unconscious aspects of oneself.  
This is more often than not a painful process. However, in the long run, existence can be  more painful when we do not mindfully examine the least comfortable aspects of our minds.  
</p>
<p>
The path of Zetesciism does not claim to provide you with quick easy solutions to changing behavior.
Zetesciism sees these type of "solutions" as further setbacks to what we you want most.
Zetesciism tries not tell you the details of what you "should" want, other than general betterment of self, greater mindfulness and discipline, balanced masochism, and ambiguously defined freedom.
</p>

<p>
Common practices include, but are not limited or restrained to, practice of mindfulness and meditation, EMDR and HAT, physical training, "pain box" exposure, and pscyhonautics.
There also exists a strong emphasis on cultural skepticism and aesthetic exploration.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Further details of the practice are currently in the works.
